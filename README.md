# RISE
We are a DAO that protects women in Puerto Rico on gender and domestic violence. The NFT represents their membership and gains access to opportunities to participate and empower in the community. Women are not protected against the legislation meant to advocate for them. 

The outlets that exist are limited and a gamble to their safety. None of these situations are one size fits all, but the value of protection is great in these adverse situations. Non-profit organization’s resource crisis situations and funds for short-term solutions are liable to scarcity. Funding is necessary to continue these services for survivors. While helpful, there are outlying problems that can further impact the safety and state of their well-being. The instability in these situations are life-changing. 

Therefore, access to a safe community where women have the opportunity to empower themselves financially supported by their long-term contributions. This rewrites the narrative and empowers women to have control in how to support their recovery and build financial stability along the way. 

The DAO is formed to globally survey each region’s top problems and begin working on the lack of solutions that statistics often display. Economic empowerment is the priority to battle against the out-of-pockets front cost of an unexpected expense and experience. 

1. Philanthropists (donors)

2. Activists (people do the work to create the concepts in the DAO)

3. Risers (survivors)

The impact on their life can be mitigated by combating the costs of:
-Healthcare
-Lost productivity
-Societal costs of criminal justice system interventions

Fundraising events across the roadmap are what operates the growth of the DAO and provide a real-world use case that promotes engagement through education and participation. 

The economy is built through the tokenization of attending workshops, leading and organizing event spaces, story-telling, artist creation, donations, mentorship programs, and passive income through the staking of these tokens. The vision is to allow women to design their stakeholder position in a timeless manner while building the larger community and accessibility in the awareness of violence against women.  

Philanthropists are investors that transform the scope of their donations across the guild. Donations are converted into tokens that further create opportunities to propose projects and can compensate activists as resources to organize and execute.

Activists are organizors and community members that are rewarded through their participation in creating awareness initiatives that actively fight violence against women. 

Risers are empowered women that cultivate future generations and mobilize and monetize the culture to raise awareness of domestic violence.

The DAO allows women to redeem their tokens in a real-world function (i.e. marketplaces in local businesses and communities of women, mental-health service providers via telehealth, that then covers costs and serves their needs.

In addition, the operations are based on being user friendly and values accessibility to store and account for proximity, costs, resources, and confidence. In turn, the DAO provides a fund for progressive growth despite not being affected by these situations real-time.
